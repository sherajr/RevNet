# RevNet
## ID and Review Attestations
One form will be a schema for self attestation which has the first name and nickname as a public strings.
The form can also have private info like phone #, e-mail, and address, which is hashed and put on-chain.
The next part will have a review schema with address, uint (1-10 rating), and string for comments.
I would really like to have a map that maps out IDs and Reveiws in some useful way.
